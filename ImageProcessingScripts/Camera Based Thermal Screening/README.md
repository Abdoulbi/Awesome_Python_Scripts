# Camera Based Thermal Screening

#### AIM:  
We will build a project that can help us in thermal screening for checking temperature using any image. This project can be done with the help of some libraries using Python programming.


#### PURPOSE: 

In this project we will be doing thermal screening based on the image taken from a video of thermal camera with the help of some libraries using Python programming.

#### DESCRIPTION:
The details of python libraries and how they are working is here- 

**LIBRARIES USED**
- **Numpy:** `numpy` forms the basis of powerful machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and SciPy. As machine learning grows, so does the list of libraries built on `numpy`. TensorFlow’s deep learning capabilities have broad applications — among them speech and image recognition, text-based applications, time-series analysis, and video detection. PyTorch, another deep learning library, is popular among researchers in computer vision and natural language processing.

- **OpenCV:** `opencv` is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License.

- **Matplotlib:** `matplotlib` is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.

#### INSTALLATION:
Install the following libraries using `pip` command in any terminal

```python
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
```
