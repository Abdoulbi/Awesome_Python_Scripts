In this tutorial, I have discussed the basic concepts of web scraping using the [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/) website, which is just made to practice the concepts of web scrapping only.

**Topics that I have covered are**
 - ```find``` method.
 - Using ```CSS Selectors```.
 - Scraping data from multiple pages
