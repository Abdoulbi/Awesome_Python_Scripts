# MADLIBS

## Short description of package/script

- Its a super fun game basically based on filling the blanks of an incomplete story which is not known to you and revealed in its final form after you give out the words.

## Workflow of the Project

You simply need an IDE and python installed in your local system.  
-Open the editor and define a function called madlibs inside which    
  
  *create a story templates that is incomplete but laid out with blanks at appropriate places which fills in for noun, adjective, verb etc.  
  *ask these blank contents from the user giving the description (e.g enter a noun )    
  
-Create as many different templates as you like in different files just like this.     
  
-Then create the main file and use import to link al these templates to the main file.    
  
-Then use random to randomise the choosing of the story each time.    
  
-And call out the function madlib from the chosen story, this would roll out the output of that story in the output terminal



## Setup instructions

Just download the entire MADLIBS_Game folder into your local system and open it in an IDE (of your choice)
