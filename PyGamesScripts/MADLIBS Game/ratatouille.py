    #MADLIB STORY
    madlib=f"""Remy, the little chef rat swirled the spoon full of {Adj1} spices into the pan on fire. Linguini saw this with his eyes 
    wide open and jaw dropped as if he was seeing {FamousPersonality1} {verb4}. Meanwhile the customer who was {FamousPersonality2} 
    asked for the same dish the pan on fire was to serve. Without any further adieu the waiter served some of the delicacies from the pan 
    into a plate to serve it the customer while linguini was busy coming out of the shock after what he saw and the rat was running his way
    down the streets of {noun1} to save his life from ah! mankind and well the {Adj2} head chef had already seen Linguini messing with the
    dish and so he rushed after the waiter {verb1} over the counter to stop him from serving it to the customer as he feared what good 
    can a garbage boy do to food but little did he knew that the little chef remy had already put all the magic the dish needed to savour 
    its way down the customer's tastebuds!"""
