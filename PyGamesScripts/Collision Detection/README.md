# Collison Detection
### A physics simulation of a 2D collision

## Overview:
Collision Detection and proper and efficient handling of Collisions batween any two rigid bodies is a key necessity of any game engine or and physics Simulation software.
The project aims to implement a physically precise model of a box and a ball setup. The implementation has two balls bouncing in a box.
The collision between the balls and the wall ie. ball-ball and ball-wall collisions are detected and handled accordingly.
Collisions are handled according to the law of conservation of Momentum and Kinetic Energy.

## Implementation:
The whole concept is leveraged with the help of the concepts of Object Oriented Programming in Python3.
Turtle library is used for the frontend graphics.
Each class defination and it's methods can be found in the `mymethods.py` file.
No additional modules/packages are necessary two run the script.

## Executing the script:
Assuming python 3 is installed in the system, the script can be executed using the following:
```
python collision_detection.py
```
A turtle window should pop-up just after this step.
