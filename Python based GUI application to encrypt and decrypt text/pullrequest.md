In this project, I have developed a GUI app that can encrypt and decrypt text.
This includes implementation of Caesar Cipher algorithm to perform the required operations.
The basic working of this app is that the app consists of a text bar where the user
enters the text.There are two options available, either the user can encrypt the text or can decrypt the text. When the user clicks on any one of the option, the operation is performed and the user is presented with the encrypted / decrypted text.
