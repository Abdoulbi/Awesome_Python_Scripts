## Document converter using python

- This is a script which is used for converting files from one extension to other (for example, to convert from jpg to pdf, pdf to word etc).

### About the Script

It takes 3 parameters as input:

- path where the file to be converted, is stored(source_path).
- path where the converted file has to be saved(destination_path).
- the name by which the converted file has to be saved.
  (for example, if we are converting "test.jpg" to "test.pdf", the program takes the path where "test.jpg" is stored,then path where "test.pdf" has to be saved along with the name by which it should be saved(test)).
