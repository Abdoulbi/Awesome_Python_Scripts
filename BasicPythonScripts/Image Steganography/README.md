# Data Hiding in Image-Steganography

## Aim/Purpose
For encrypting data in an image and decrypting the same with a secret key

## Short description of package/script
Steganography is a technique of hiding a message within image or audio files. It means of storing data in a way that it hides the existence of them. 
In this project, I've used the module named **cryptosteganography** in python

## Workflow of the Project
We use this method when we don't want anyone else to see the message other than the sender and the intended receiver. This process helps in enhancing the security of the message.
1.) encode the data with a secret key
2.) decode the data by providing the correct secret key

## Setup instructions
For setup we just need to install **cryptosteganography** module and then just run the script and provide the details as shown in the image below

Installation:
To install the package on windows, run the command below in the cmd
