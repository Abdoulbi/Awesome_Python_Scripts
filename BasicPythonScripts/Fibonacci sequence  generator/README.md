## FIBONACCI SEQUENCE GENERATOR
  It's a program where we play with mathematical integers and operation to genarate a unique series.
  
### **_Title_**
To generate a seires called "Fibonacci Series"

### **_What it is ?_** 
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

#### _Explanation with the help of example :-_
Predefined,  

1st no.(F0) =0     

2nd no.(F1) = 1

So the third number will be F2 = F0 + F1 

Similarly the fourth number will be F3 = F1 + F2 ..........and so on
