# INVISIBLE CLOAK

  Hello EVERYONE,lets do some magic using computer vision. I hope you all know about ‘invisible cloak’, this will make you invisible. We will see how we can do the same magic       trick   with the help of computer vision. I will code with python and use the opencv library.
  
# REQUIREMENTS
  
  1. python 3.5 and above
  2. opencv
  
# DESCRIPTION
  
  We wll learn how to create our own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV. Here we have written this code in Python because it provides             exhaustive and sufficient library to build this program.

  Here, we will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. In order to run this code, you need an mp4 video named   “video.mp4“. You must have a cloth of same color and no other color should be visible into that cloth. We are taking the red cloth. If you are taking some other cloth, the code   will remain the same but with minute changes.
