# Quotes Automation
For quotes automation we are using `quote` library which is a python wrapper for the Goodreads Quote API. 
To generate a random quote we will be using the quote function from the quote module.

### Installation

Install with `pip` command in any terminal
```python
pip install poetpy
```

### Working

It is simple to use and `quote` library can also be used from the command line tool.

```python
from quote import quote

author = 'Albert Einstein'

result = quote(author, limit=2)

print(result)
```

### Output
#### In PyCharm




#### In CLI
